This project describes the ZOZOSUIT and develops an app that allows users to take one picture of their body and receive a 3D-model according to their picture. \newline
This replicates the original app created by ZOZO inc. in 2018. 

To accomplish this a mobile app using Flutter is developed along with a server that receives the picture and extracts measurement points. These points are then used to create the model. \newline
The server returns the model to the app, which then renders and displays it.
